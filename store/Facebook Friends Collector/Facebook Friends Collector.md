## 4. Easy & safe authentication { argument }

This automation will connect to Facebook on your behalf. The **safest and most efficient** way for Phantombuster to authenticate as yourself is by using your session cookies.

To make that process as easy as possible you can use **Phantombuster's browser extension**. It's a 2-click installation.

If you're operating from **another browser** and/or want to do it manually, [here is how to do it](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/how-to-get-your-cookies-without-using-our-browser-extension).

## 5. Add a Google Spreadsheet 📑
Below your session cookies you’ll find Spreadsheet URL.

Add in the Spreadsheet URL textbox the link of a Google spreadsheet with this same format **(Share option must be OPEN)**.

Your spreadsheet should contain a list of Facebook Profile URLs (**one link per row**).

You can specify the name of the column that contains the profile links. Simply enter the column name in the next text field.
You can also enter a single Facebook profile URL directly in the field.


# ⚙️️Repetition setup ⚙️

Now that your API is ready, you can customize it to make it work repetitively.

Use to 'Number of profiles to process per launch' field to configure how many profiles you want to scrape per launch (5 for instance will make it 5 profiles each launch then stop). Then set a repetition setup:

To do so, simply hit the “Settings” button to define when your API is launched.

Then, select a frequency:

Now that this is set, click 💾 <span style="color:blue">Save</span> at the bottom of the page.

There you go, the scraping will be made for you without you doing anything!


# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It’s done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

# Limits

Please be aware that this API will manipulate your own account on your behalf.

Since Phantombuster's servers are located on the west coast of the USA, Facebook might to consider those login attempts as unusual activities. It's likely that they'll then temporarily lock your account and ask you to confirm your login.

In order to use the Facebook APIs to their max potential, we recommend [using a proxy](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/setting-up-a-proxy-with-phantombuster) close to you.

Also Facebook tends to notice when too many profiles viewings are done in a short period of time. We recommend spreading your scraping (like 5 profiles every 30min rather than 100 profiles in one go).
If too many viewing actions are done, Facebook will warn you and temporarily block profile viewing on your account for about one hour. If that happens, you should be careful and reduce your scraping frequency the next time.
